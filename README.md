## 🔎 About The Project

Car IQ is an iOS application that leverages deep learning and computer vision to detect and recognize cars from images. The user can take a picture of a car or upload one from their gallery, and the app will identify key attributes such as:

- 🚗 Make (e.g. Nissan)
- 🏷️ Model (e.g. GT-R)
- 🕓 Generation and Year Range (e.g. I (R35) facelift 3, 2016–2023)
- ✅ Confidence Score (e.g. 96%)
